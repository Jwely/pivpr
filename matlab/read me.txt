/Data2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	root directory containing all files used for matlab processing of data
	including [output.xls]. Test matrices are included as well as multiple 	
	index files.

		BatchCropDirectory.m
			matlab function to batch autocrop white space out of all images
			in a directory, used for final formating of plots.
		CoreIndex.txt
			Contains a list of all core locations by run number, these core		
			locations were found manually using the tools within the matlab
			program marked Vanalysis
		Load3d.m
			Loads raw vector data and performs averaging operations, weeding
			grid point data which does not have at least 3 good runs.
			Translates this data into two files which are stored in each runs	
			vector directory. One is DynData.txt, which is a 2-dimensionalized
			representation of ALL data runs for dynamic turbulence processing 
			via the Vanalysis m file. The other is AvgData.xls, which contains
			data in the format of.
			
				[x,y,z,u,v,w,Uu,Uv,Uw,N,Uu/u,Uv/v,Uw/w]

		1-3	x,y,z    = coordinates
		4-6	u,v,w    = velocity components
		7-9	Uu,Uv,Uw = Uncertainty in those components
		10	N	 = Number of good values which the data came from
		11-13	Uu/u etc = Normalized Uncertainty values as percentage of Vfree
		
			(The normalized uncertainty values i believe ended up unused)

		Output.xls
			Vtheta_Max and Rcore data by run, unlabled run numbers.

		
		TerminalVanalysis.m
			The script file to run when full automation of data processing
			is required. 

		Vanalysis.m
			Data processor, responsible for all output data and fully 
customizable

		Testmatrix.xls
			Master tracker of run data, Numerical Final results are recorded
			here

/Data2/Ely_May28th/Output charts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Contains all output figures

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/Data2/Ely_May28th/Vector
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Contains all vector data as well as files produced by Load3d. This data is produced
	from the raw image data and relevant calibration data by INSIGHT.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/Data2/Ely_May28th/Image
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Raw PIV Image data.	
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/Data2/Ely_May28th/Calibration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Contains calibration data necessary to properly process the image files.
	There are 7 calibrations, one for each location of data, see the master testmatrix
	file for clarification.

EVERYTHING in these directories was produced by Jeffry W Ely towards completion of 
a masters thesis and coresponding degree in Aerospace Engineering from ODU in Norfolk VA.
