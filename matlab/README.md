## matlab
Code for synthesis of PIV data for demonstration of pressure relaxation phenomena. This is the first and oldest code base writen in matlab. The documentation isn't quite as clear as it could be, and the use of proprietary matlab reduces accessibility. The code is saved here for good record keeping, but the final version is implemented in [python](../py) with numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
