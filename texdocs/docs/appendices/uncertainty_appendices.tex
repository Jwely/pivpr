\chapter{Measurement Uncertainty}

Tabulated tables of uncertainty in the measurements by $u, v$ and $w$ 
components. For the $u$ velocity components in the $X$ direction, the 
measurement is $\bar{u}$, bias are reported as $\beta_u$, precisions are 
reported for both single sample measurements and with measurements comprised of 
200 averages by $P_{u^\prime}$ and $P_{\bar{u}}$ respectively, and total 
uncertainties are reported as $U_{u^\prime}$ and $U_{\bar{u}}$.
