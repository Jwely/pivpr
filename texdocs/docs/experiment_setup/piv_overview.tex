\section{PIV Overview}Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a flow measurement technique using a flow seed particulate, precisely illumination by a laser, and special cameras which take multiple closely spaced pictures of the flow. First, the fluid flow is seeded with an aerosolized oil fog, which forms tiny, low mass droplets which become well entrained in the air. A laser is broadcast into a very thin sheet which illuminates a cross section of the flow, where small inhomogeneities in the distribution of seed particles can be seen. Cameras are positioned to take pictures of the particulate seed in rapid succession, such that the displacement of any particular particle group is just a few pixels in the image plane of the camera. By tracking movements of particle groupings through each image taken at a specific and precise moments in time, with detailed information about the geometry of optical setup, displacements in the pixel domain can be mapped into displacements in the real spatial domain. These displacements can then be translated into velocities.Particle image velocimetry has several advantages and disadvantages over other flow measurement techniques. Firstly, PIV is non-invasive, with no solid positioning system and sensor probe to create its own wake and influence on the flow field. Secondly, PIV can make instantaneous and simultaneous measurements of an entire two dimensional surface within a flow field. This can greatly reduce uncertainty associated with single point surveys over a flow field where variation in time and space require very fine control over temperature, humidity, and free stream velocity of the flow field in order to isolate. Thirdly, PIV can be scaled to accommodate multi dimensional requirements. One camera and laser is sufficient to measure two dimensional velocity components in a two dimensional slice of space as in figure \ref{fig:mono_piv}. Two cameras and a laser is sufficient to measure three dimensional velocitycomponents in a two dimensional slice of space as in figure\ref{fig:stereo_piv2}. With multiple polarized laser beams, it is possible evento measure three dimensional velocity fields within a volume of space. \begin{figure}[H]	\centering	\includegraphics[width=5in]{figs/piv_method/mono_piv_optics}	\caption{Single camera PIV system for mapping two dimensional velocity 	vectors}	\label{fig:mono_piv}\end{figure} \begin{figure}[H]	\centering	\includegraphics[width=5in]{figs/piv_method/stereo_piv_optics}	\caption{Stereo camera PIV system for mapping three dimensional velocity 		vectors}	\label{fig:stereo_piv2}\end{figure} A significant disadvantage is that the sampling rate is restricted by the shutter speed on the cameras, and this shutter speed can easily be slower than the time scales at which turbulent phenomena may occur. As technology improves,this disadvantage is slowly vanishing, as cameras with sampling rates on theorder of 20kHz are becoming available, though at extremely high cost. Anadditional disadvantage which also erodes with improved computing power is therelatively high computational intensity of processing large volumes of rawimage data into fully resolved vector fields, especially at a high samplingrate.The present study uses a stereo PIV system which resolves three dimensional vectors gridded to a two dimensional cross section of flow. The cameras used are  are capable of taking two images a few microseconds apart, but cannot fully open and close the shutter that quickly. Deriving velocity vectors requires two images just a few microseconds apart, but pairs of images can be taken at greater time intervals. The PIV method used in this study relies upon a frame straddling technique, that times laser pulses at the edges of the camera exposures in order to meet this requirement. This results in two cameras, which simultaneously take a pair of images, and 25-50 microseconds later take a second pair of snapshots for a total of four images, $Ra$, $Rb$, $La$, and $Lb$. This can be repeated once every second, resulting in a true sampling frequency of 1Hz.\subsection{Mathematical Basis}The mathematics behind derivation of velocity vector fields from stereo image pairs is based upon coordinate transformations from pixel coordinates to real coordinates with the following equations \ref{eq:piv_to_real1} to \ref{eq:piv_to_real4}.\begin{equation}	x_L= X\frac{dx_L}{dX} + Y\frac{dx_L}{dY} + Z\frac{dx_L}{dZ}	\label{eq:piv_to_real1}\end{equation}\begin{equation}	x_R= X\frac{dx_R}{dX} + Y\frac{dx_R}{dY} + Z\frac{dx_R}{dZ}	\label{eq:piv_to_real2}\end{equation}\begin{equation}	y_L= X\frac{dy_L}{dX} + Y\frac{dy_L}{dY} + Z\frac{dy_L}{dZ}	\label{eq:piv_to_real3}\end{equation}\begin{equation}	y_R= X\frac{dy_R}{dX} + Y\frac{dy_R}{dY} + Z\frac{dy_R}{dZ}	\label{eq:piv_to_real4}\end{equation}where $x_L$, $x_R$, $y_L$ and $y_R$ are the pixel displacements in the x direction on the left and right cameras, and the y direction on the left and right cameras respectively. Symbols $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are real spatial particle displacements in the interrogation plane. The set of twelve derivatives are pixel displacement sensitivity coefficients, which are determined by a calibration process which involves taking pictures of a matrix of bright dots with a known distance between each dot. Once all twelve calibration coefficients are known, the set of equations is actually over constrained, with four equations and only three unknowns, a least squared method will be used to map measurements form the image plane to the real plane. In the case of this study, INSIGHT software was used to generate this set of calibration coefficients.Pixel displacements are computed by significantly up sampling the images by interpolation, dividing each image into many small sectors, and comparing an  image $A$ with a image $B$ with a correlation map. The image is up sampled to higher resolution to allow sub-pixel displacements to be measured, thus preventing accuracy limitations associated with the physical dimensions of each pixel. The image is typically divided into grids 16 by 16 pixels in size, with 50\% overlap with surrounding grids to ensure particles which started inside the sector at $t=0$, but begin to exit the sector at $t=dt$, are still identifiable.  The correlation map is computed by taking the inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the product of the FFT of the first image, and the complex conjugate of the FFT of the second image, then adjusting for up-sampling by dividing by the original factor as in equation \ref{eq:correlation_map}.\begin{equation}	C_{map} = FFT^{-1} * [F_A \times conj(F_B) ]	\label{eq:correlation_map}\end{equation}where $C_{map}$ is the correlation map, $F_A$ is the fast Fourier transform of image $A$, at time $t=0$ and $F_B$ is the fast Fourier transform of image $B$ at time $t=dt$.Figure \ref{fig:piv_sector_0up} shows a sample of two side by side images taken several microseconds, $dt$ apart without any up-sampling. Figure \ref{fig:piv_sector_overlay_fft_0up} shows a sample of the same two images layered on top of each other to show the apparent horizontal displacement between the two images. The two dimensional correlation map shows a clear peak down at four pixels in the $X$ direction and zero pixels in the $Y$ direction.\begin{figure}[H]	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{figs/piv_method/pive_figa_order0}	\end{subfigure} 	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{figs/piv_method/pive_figb_order0}	\end{subfigure}		\caption{Colorized 32x32 pixel contour images at $t=0$ (left), and $t=dt$ 	(right), no up sampling.}	\label{fig:piv_sector_0up}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[H]	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{figs/piv_method/pive-fig_order0}	\end{subfigure} 	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{figs/piv_method/pive_fft_order0}	\end{subfigure}		\caption{Overlaid sector snapshots (left) and corresponding correlation 	map (right), no up sampling.}	\label{fig:piv_sector_overlay_fft_0up}\end{figure}Every up sampling doubles the dimensions of the sector, quadrupling the number of pixels and increasing the sub-pixel resolution by a factor of two. The same set of figures is repeated for the same image with 6th order bilinear up sampling in figures \ref{fig:piv_sector_6up} and\ref{fig:piv_sector_overlay_fft_6up}. Note that the images are much smoother, and the images have been sampled sufficiently to make a very finely spaced grid.It is important to note that while bilinear up sampling is used for thisexample, any other two dimensional method such as cubic may be used.\begin{figure}[H]	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{figs/piv_method/pive_figa_order6}	\end{subfigure} 	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{figs/piv_method/pive_figb_order6}	\end{subfigure}		\caption{Colorized 32x32 pixel contour images at $t=0$ (left), and $t=dt$ 		(right), 6th order up sampling.}	\label{fig:piv_sector_6up}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[H]	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{figs/piv_method/pive-fig_order6}	\end{subfigure} 	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{figs/piv_method/pive_fft_order6}	\end{subfigure}		\caption{Overlaid sector snapshots (left) and corresponding correlation 		map (right), 6th order up sampling.}	\label{fig:piv_sector_overlay_fft_6up}\end{figure}As the sampling method creates a finer mesh, the sub-pixel resolution increases. Table \ref{table:piv_upsampling_displacement} shows how the displacement error may vary with sampling order.\input{tables/piv_upsampling_displacement}While the above analysis demonstrates the mathematical motivation behind up sampling images before performing a Fourier transform for measuring particle displacement, it does not adequately describe the total uncertainty in measurements made with particle image velocimetry. The uncertainty associated with measurements made with PIV are dependent upon the geometry of the specific optical setup used to take the data.\subsection{Seeding the Flow}Appropriate particle seeding density and time between straddled frames is thesubject of continued study, and is difficult to predict before hand. Completeness of a two dimensional vector field is highly dependent upon uniformoptimal particle density conditions which are difficult to obtain, and maintainover an extended test. For stereo PIV, incomplete data in either of the two dimensional vector sets from either camera at a given spatial location will result in an indeterminate vector displacement in the three dimensional vector data. To elevate the likelihood that a displacement vector at a given location can be properly determined, an additional data refining technique outlined in Hart (flag, reference) was employed. The Hart method compares correlation maps between two adjacent sectors for consistency. in instances where two adjacent regions lack a well-defined peak, the Hart method functions to magnify shared peaks and reveal a solution that might otherwise have been missed. In instances where sub optimal seeding conditions were present and a correlation map produces a false peak, the Hart method functions to rule the peak out as an anomaly if the adjacent sectors do not also indicate a high correlation at that location \cite{hart1998}. The way in which in which the Hart method reduces the number of erroneous vectors present in a data set is difficult to quantify on a case by case basis, but any impact on overall uncertainty of the PIV measurements is expected to have a reducing effect.
