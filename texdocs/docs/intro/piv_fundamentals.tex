\section{Fundamentals of Particle Image Velocimetry}

Particle Image Velocimetry, or PIV, is a class of methods employed by 
experimental fluid mechanics to measure instantaneous vector velocity fields by 
measuring the displacements of small visible particles which follow the motion 
of the fluid \cite{adrian2011}.
