\section{Established Vortex models}
Several vortex models are already commonly used to describe the behavior of 
axial wake vortices. Among these models are, in order of introduction, the 
Rankine, Lamb-Oseen, Burnham-Hallock, and Proctor models \cite{ahmad2014}. The 
simplest and oldest model, the Rankine vortex, approximates the azimuthal 
velocity of the vortex within the core zone as a rigid body of rotating fluid, 
with that component of velocity decreasing as dictated by an inviscid potential 
flow model, predicting that the azimuthal velocity decreases with the inverse 
of radius beyond the central core boundary \cite{rankine1869}. The azimuthal 
velocity profile of a Rankine vortex is given by

\begin{equation}
v_{\theta}(r) = \frac{\Gamma_0}{2 \pi r_{core}} \frac{r}{r_{core}} 
	\text{ for } r \leq r_{core}
	\label{eq:rankine1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
v_{\theta}(r) = \frac{\Gamma_0}{2 \pi r}
	\text{ for } r > r_{core}
	\label{eq:rankine2}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\Gamma_0$ is the circulation and $r_{core}$ is the core radius,
which is defined as the location of the maximum azimuthal velocity, 
$v_{\theta, max}$. The azimuthal velocity $v_{\theta}$, is proportional to 
radius $r$, in the core zone, but proportional to $1/r$ in the region outside 
the core zone. This shear stress discontinuity makes the model unsuitable in 
the vicinity of the core region of the vortex. The model is therefore 
unsuitable for the study of unsteady flow or turbulence, and the rigid body 
assumption within the core has been shown experimentally to be invalid.

Much later, the Lamb-Oseen vortex model was developed from an 
analytical solution to the Navier-Stokes equations \cite{lamb1932}. In this 
model, a potential 
line vortex with an infinite velocity at the centerline was introduced 
instantaneously as a point, then subjected to viscous decay. This is an 
unsteady solution for the azimuthal 
velocity profile at any time after the introduction of the discontinuity, given 
as

\begin{equation}
v_{\theta}(r,t) = \frac{\Gamma_0}{2 \pi r_{core}}[1 - 
							exp(-(r / r_{core})^2)]
	\label{eq:lamb1}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where the core radius dilates according to 

\begin{equation}
r_{core}(t) = \sqrt{4 \nu t}
	\label{eq:lamb2}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Utilizing the kinematic viscosity, $\nu$. Alternatively, the azimuthal velocity 
profile can be expressed in terms of the maximum azimuthal velocity, 
$v_{\theta, max}$, as

\begin{equation}
v_{\theta}(r,t) = v_{\theta, max} (1 + \frac{1}{2 \alpha}) \frac{r_{max}}{r} 
[1 - exp(- \alpha \frac{r^2}{r_{max}^2})]
\label{eq:lamb3}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where the core radius dilates according to 

\begin{equation}
r_{core}(t) = \sqrt{\alpha 4 \nu t}
\label{eq:lamb4}
\end{equation}

\noindent
In the case where $\alpha = 1.25643$ \cite{davenport1996}. Like the Rankine 
vortex, a 
Lamb-Oseen vortex does not allow for unsteady flow. In addition, the predicted 
centerline velocity at $r=0$ is undefined. It has utility in estimating average 
velocity profiles, and has been used to initialize large eddy 
simulations \cite{hennemann2011}.

A model which is widely used in the study of wake vortices, and demonstrates 
great suitability for modeling the velocity profiles of large experimental 
vortices is the Burnham-Hallock model \cite{burnham1982}. This 
empirically-based model has been independently discovered by many 
\cite{burnam2013}, and describes the azimuthal velocity profile as

\begin{equation}
v_{\theta}(r) = \frac{\Gamma_0}{2 \pi r_{core}} \Big(\frac{r^2}{r^2 + 
r_{core}^2} \Big)
\label{eq:burnham-hallock}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Similar to the Lamb-Oseen vortex, the Burnham-Hallock model has been widely 
used to initialize large eddy simulations and model aircraft response to wake 
encounters \cite{ahmad2014}.

\section{Vortex Model with non-equilibrium Pressure}

Non-equilibrium pressure influences on an incompressible, Newtonian fluid can 
be introduced through the application of the Hamilton variational principle.
\cite{zuckerwar2006} employed this approach in an attempt to clarify confusion 
associated with the volume or bulk viscosity coefficient for simple fluids. 
They were concerned primarily with its relevance to high-speed compressible 
flows. When Hamilton's principle was subjected to conservation of mass, 
conservation of reacting species, and material entropy constraints, the 
procedure resulted in 
two dissipative coefficients in the Navier Stokes equation; a traditional 
volume viscosity term and a term that was proportional to the material time 
derivative of the pressure gradient \cite{zuckerwar2009}. The resulting 
modified Navier Stokes equation can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\rho \frac{Dv}{Dt} = - \nabla[P - \eta_p] -
\rho \nabla \Omega + 
\nabla[(\eta_v - \frac{2}{3} \mu)\nabla \cdot \pmb{\text{v}})] + 
\nabla \times (\mu \nabla \times \pmb{\text{v}}) + 
2[\nabla \cdot (\mu \nabla)] \pmb{\text{v}}
\label{eq:modified_ns1}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\eta_p$ is the pressure relaxation coefficient, $\eta_v$ is the volume 
viscosity, $P$ is pressure, $\rho$ is density of the fluid, and $\mu$ is the 
dynamic viscosity. If each of the thermophysical parameters are considered 
to be constant, and body forces are 
neglected, the resulting conservation of momentum equation simplifies to 

\begin{equation}
\rho \frac{Dv}{Dt} = - \nabla P + \eta_p \nabla \frac{DP}{Dt} - 
(\eta_v + \frac{4}{3}\nu) \nabla (\nabla \cdot\pmb{\text{v}})
- \mu \nabla \times (\nabla \times \cdot\pmb{\text{v}})
\label{eq:modified_ns2}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Alternatively, Equation \ref{eq:modified_ns2} can be expressed in index 
notation as 

\begin{equation}
\rho \frac{Dv_i}{Dt} = -\frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i} +
\eta_p \frac{D}{Dt} \Bigg( \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i} \Bigg) + 
\mu \frac{\partial^2 v_i}{\partial x_{k}^2} + 
\eta_p \Bigg[\frac{\partial v_k}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_k} -
\frac{\eta_v + (\frac{1}{3}\mu)}{\eta_p} \frac{\partial}{\partial 
x_i} \Bigg( \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{D\rho}{Dt} \Bigg) \Bigg]
\label{eq:modified_ns3}
\end{equation}

The term in brackets has been examined and appears to be related to sound 
production 
in incompressible flows \cite{ash1998}, but in any scenario, it should be 
negligibly small 
when multiplied by the pressure relaxation coefficient. Thus, Equation 
\ref{eq:modified_ns3} can be dramatically simplified \cite{ash2011}.

\begin{equation}
\rho \frac{Dv_i}{Dt} = -\frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i} +
\eta_p \frac{D}{Dt} \Bigg( \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i} \Bigg) + 
\mu \frac{\partial^2 v_i}{\partial x_{k}^2} + 
\label{eq:modified_ns4}
\end{equation}

When applied to a steady, incompressible axial vortex with zero axial velocity, 
the azimuthal velocity profile is described by

\begin{equation}
v_\theta(r) = \frac{\Gamma_0}{\pi} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R_\Gamma \sqrt{\nu \eta_p}}
\frac{(r / r_{core})}{(r/r_{core})^2 + 1}
\label{eq:ash_vortex_model}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $R_\Gamma$ is the circulation based Reynolds number. The maximum 
azimuthal velocity occurs where $r = r_{core}$, and can be represented as

\begin{equation}
v_{\theta, max} = \frac{\Gamma_0}{\pi} \frac{1}{R_\Gamma \sqrt{2 \nu 
\eta_p}}
\label{eq:ash_vthetamax}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Therefore, in terms of azimuthal velocity, Equation \ref{eq:ash_vortex_model} 
becomes

\begin{equation}
v_\theta(r) = 2 v_{\theta, max}\frac{(r / r_{core})}{(r/r_{core})^2 + 1}
\label{eq:ash_vortex_model2}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:ash_vortex_model2} is the same form as the 
empirically based Burnham-Hallock model, but is an exact solution to the 
modified Navier Stokes equations. As the pressure relaxation coefficient 
tends to zero, the solution becomes a potential vortex similar to the 
Lamb-Oseen model. For very large pressure relaxation coefficients, the velocity 
distribution becomes similar to that of a rigid body rotation as in the inner 
portion of the Rankine model.


\section{Turbulent Structure of Axial Vortices}

Understanding the turbulent structure of an axial vortex is critical to 
understanding the mechanisms controlling vortex decay. Axial wake vortices 
typically 
start with axial velocity deficits at their centers and strong rotational 
momentum about their cores. Turbulence is responsible for the observed rapid 
decay of the axial velocity deficit in the core region, but its influence on 
the relatively slow decay of the rotational velocity profile is  unclear. 
Vortices have been shown to quickly absorb large 
scale turbulent structures, and break them up into smaller ones 
\cite{ragab1994,beninati2005}. This activity 
is associated with the exchange of momentum between the vortex core and the 
rotating surroundings, strengthening the near rigid body rotation of the core 
region and relaminarizing subsequently the inner vortex region 
\cite{bandyopadhyay1991}. Organized motions surrounding the core 
cause intermittent ejections of fluid with low momentum and high vorticity, and 
entrainment and laminarization of highly turbulent fluid into the core 
\cite{bandyopadhyay1991}. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) has shown 
intense turbulent structures in the free stream to impact the longevity of a 
vortex formed within it, with large scale motions causing long wave instability 
and slight periodic movements of the vortex core (wobbling), and small scale 
motions enhancing the diffusion of vorticity 
between the core region and the free stream \cite{risso1997}. It is 
unsurprising that the turbulent structure of an axial vortex likely depends
upon local atmospheric conditions, and thus the ambient environment can 
influence the rate at which a vortex decays. This has a significant impact on 
aviation safety \cite{ash1998}. 

The vortex model developed by Ash, Zardadkhan 
and Zuckerwar comes from an exact solution to the modified Navier Stokes 
equations, employing a simple turbulent eddy viscosity assumption 
\cite{ash2011}. 
Since that model merely changes the ratio of the effective 
viscosity to the pressure relaxation coefficient, the resulting axial velocity 
profile continues to be identical with the empirical Burnham-Hallock model. 
Specific assumptions for the turbulent viscosity model and Reynolds stresses 
will be examined in the present study.
