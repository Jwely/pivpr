\section{Discussion}

Axial vortices were created over a range of velocities, and interrogated at 
seven different stations ranging between 546$mm$ and 1016$mm$ downstream, or 
5.4 and 10.0 chord lengths respectively. For the 
purposes of results and discussion, it is desirable to reduce the set to a few 
exemplary data sets that illustrate observed phenomena. The vortex generator 
used in these experiments had a center body with a 1 inch diameter, and thus 
produced two co-rotating vortices that merge together as they moved downstream. 
The first three stations display characteristics that resemble co-rotating 
vortices that had not yet finished merging. Furthermore, analysis shows that 
the uncertainty in measurements decreases significantly as the interrogation 
plane moves down stream. Therefore, results from only a few vortices at 
downstream locations of are discussed here. Full results for all vortices 
generated can be obtained from an online public repository, the URL for which 
can be found in the notes. Turbulent quantities are compared to hot-wire 
anemometry experiments conducted by Thompson \cite{thompson2016}.


\subsection{Vortex Stabilization}
A bi wing vortex generator actually creates a set of co-rotating vortices from 
the intersections of the wing and center body or the wing edges. A single axial 
vortex stabilizes as the co rotating vortices merge together and as the 
wake of the center body diminishes. The rotational motion of the vortex 
stretches the axial velocity deficit around the core region. This was observed 
in the PIV data in Figure \ref{fig:run_1_W_contour} showing a far upstream 
average axial velocity distribution with very clear wing wakes coming off 
center, and in Figure \ref{fig:run_55_W_contour} showing a downstream station 
at a higher velocity with wake remnants wound about the core.

Each wing generated a lifting force which converted axial momentum into radial 
and tangential momentum about the vortex core. As the vortex developed, radial 
movements in the fluid persisted with similar magnitude, though were broken up 
into smaller localized jets as shown in Figures \ref{fig:run_1_R_contour} and 
\ref{fig:run_51_R_contour}, which were taken at similar free stream velocities 
but several chord lengths apart.

Under the conditions of early vortex formation, stronger asymmetry was seen in 
the azimuthal velocity component, $\bar{t}$ than in more developed vortices as 
shown in Figures \ref{fig:run_1_T_contour} and \ref{fig:run_55_T_contour}. When 
this data is flattened into a scatter plot for every grid point making up the 
two dimensional dataset, the asymmetries become particularly apparent as shown 
in Figure \ref{fig:run_1_T_vs_r_mesh_scatter}.

Vortices are characterized principally by the maximum azimuthal velocity 
and the radius of the core. The absolute maximum velocity from the scatter plot 
is likely to be impacted by random noise in the data, and may 
not occur near the true core boundary. Therefore, the vortices were 
characterized by taking a moving average of the azimuthal velocity plot, and 
taking the maximum value and radial point at which it occurs. Thus, more 
developed vortices with greater radial symmetry were better suited for further 
study. With a smoothed azimuthal velocity profile, the experimental data were 
compared to the theoretical profiles of common vortices introduced previously, 
as in figure \ref{fig:run_55_comparison}. In this comparison, the Lamb-Oseen 
and Ash vortices are scaled to match the experimental maximum azimuthal 
velocity, while the Rankine vortex is scaled to match the core radius.

A summary of these characteristics can be found in Tables 
\ref{table:experiment_results_1} through \ref{table:experiment_results_7}.

The vortex core sizes at all velocities were observed to drop from 
17-20$mm$ in radius to 13-16$mm$ in radius between station 4 at 8.5 chord 
lengths and station 5 at 9 chord lengths. The abrupt contraction of the core my 
be attributable to the instability created by the wake of the vortex generator 
center body. As the core diameter decreased, the azimuthal velocities were also 
observed to increase sharply as the fast moving fluid accelerates inward to 
tighten the core boundary. Figure \ref{fig:run_35_R_contour} shows nearly 
opposed and well defined regions of radial velocity into the core (-) and out 
of the core(+). Figure \ref{fig:run_45_R_contour} shows the dispersion of these 
radial velocity structures just one half chord length further downstream, at 
the same free stream velocity.
