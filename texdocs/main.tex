\abstract{
	Vortices are a common phenomenon in fluid flows that arise to dissipate 
	kinetic energy into heat via viscous interaction. They arise naturally at 
	large scales in the form of dust devils, tornadoes, and in the wake of 
	aircraft. It is important to understand the conditions leading to their 
	formation, their duration, and their dissipation to prevent undesirable 
	effects. Among these effects is an decrease in safety of aircraft 
	operations in the wake of other aircraft, an extremely common situation at 
	airports around the world. A large number of mathematical models and 
	experimental data exists to help explain various aspects of axial wake 
	vortex behavior, but current models fail to understand why many vortices 
	remain tightly wound about their cores for as long as they have been 
	observed to do. The current study builds upon the theoretical work of Ash, 
	Zardadkhan and Zuckerwar \cite{ash2011}, and tests specific attributes of a 
	vortex for agreement with non-equilibrium pressure relaxation theory. A 
	bi-wing vortex generator was constructed, and placed in a low speed wind 
	tunnel. Stereo particle image velocimetry was employed to map three 
	dimensional velocity vectors in a plan perpendicular to the free stream 
	flow direction at a rate of 1Hz for 200 seconds. A Reynolds time averaging 
	approach was used to synthesize this velocity data into stable and 
	fluctuating components. Free stream velocity and downstream distance were 
	varied to create a variety of vortices, and to ensure the availability of 
	high quality data.

Good practice for preserving the code used to perform this research was 
attempted by use of the Git work flow and a Git repository. All code used to 
perform data analysis and visualization, along with the raw three dimensional 
vector dataset can be downloaded for free from

\chapter{Experiment Setup}
A complete particle image velocimetry system was installed in the ODU low speed 
wind tunnel and employed to measure three-dimensional velocity fields produced 
by an axial vortex at multiple nominal velocities $V_{nom}$ and multiple 
interrogation planes. The interrogation planes were defined by their 
distance downstream of trailing edges of the bi-wing the vortex generator 
$I_Z$. Nominal wind tunnel velocity was varied from 15$m/s$ to 33$m/s$, 
sampling 10 distinct velocities in increments of 2$m/s$. The interrogation 
plane was moved at irregular intervals from 546$mm$ to 1016$mm$ as shown in 
table \ref{table:test_matrix_table}. This chapter discuss details of the 
experimental setup used to produce these datasets, including wind tunnel 
control, vortex generator setup, PIV system calibration, data acquisition, data 
processing, and data quality control.
