\abstract{
	Vortices are a common phenomenon in fluid flows that arise as kinetic 
	energy dissipates into heat via viscous interaction. They arise naturally 
	at large scales in the form of dust devils, tornadoes, and in the wake of 
	aircraft. It is important to understand the conditions leading to their 
	formation, their duration, and their dissipation to prevent undesirable 
	effects. Among these effects is an decrease in safety of aircraft 
	operations in the wake of other aircraft, an extremely common situation at 
	airports around the world. A large number of mathematical models and 
	experimental data exists to help explain various aspects of axial wake 
	vortex behavior, but current models fail to understand why many vortices 
	remain tightly wound about their cores for as long as they have been 
	observed to do. The current study builds upon the theoretical work of Ash, 
	Zardadkhan and Zuckerwar \cite{ash2011}, and tests specific attributes of a 
	vortex for agreement with non-equilibrium pressure relaxation theory. This 
	theory provides an exact solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for an 
	axial vortex, with a resulting velocity model that agrees with leading 
	empirical models. Axial wake vortices were created with a bi-wing vortex 
	generator in a low speed wind tunnel, at free stream velocities between 15 
	and 33 $m/s$. Stereo particle image velocimetry was employed to 
	map three dimensional velocity vectors at positions between 5.4 and 10 
	chord lengths behind the vortex generator at a rate of 1Hz for 200 seconds. 
	A Reynolds time averaging approach was used to synthesize this velocity 
	data into stable and fluctuating components and to study turbulent 
	structures within the vortices.The core of these vortices was observed to 
	periodically ingest turbulent energy and squeeze it to within one half of a 
	core radii. The cyclical ingestion of turbulence was shown to have the 
	effect of significantly reducing the core radius. If this phenomena 
	persists for the life of the vortex, it could provide an explanation for 
	the longevity of the azimuthal velocity component observed in natural wake 
	vortices.

\chapter{Introduction}
Vortices are common natural fluid phenomenon which are extensively scrutinized 
in the study of turbulent flows. While small vortical structures appear and 
disappear without notice, some circumstances promote the formation of strong 
axial vortices that endure. Some such axial vortices are found trailing the 
wake of aircraft wingtips, and in nature as dust devils, tornadoes, and 
waterspouts. Wingtip vortices behind large aircraft create unsafe conditions 
for other aircraft, especially around airport runways. The presence of axial 
wake vortices is a significant limiting factor on the volume of traffic an 
airport can accommodate \cite{hallock1991}. While the circumstances that result 
in the creation of strong axial vortices are well understood, the mechanisms 
that allow them to stay tightly wound for as long as they do remain mysterious. 
Due to the spontaneous nature of tornadoes, good experimental data is difficult 
to acquire and repeat. Axial wake vortices behave differently for 
small aircraft or in wind tunnels at low Reynolds number than they do for large 
aircraft or at high Reynolds numbers \cite{burnam2013}. Multiple empirical and 
analytical exact solutions exist to describe the velocity profiles of axial 
vortices, each with varying levels of skill.

In this analysis, A bi-wing vortex generator was constructed, and placed in 
a low speed wind tunnel. Stereo particle image velocimetry was employed to 
map three dimensional velocity vectors in a plan perpendicular to the free 
stream flow direction at a rate of 1Hz for 200 seconds. A Reynolds time 
averaging approach was used to synthesize this velocity data into stable 
and fluctuating components. Free stream velocity and downstream distance 
were varied to create a vortices at a variety of Reynolds numbers and produce a 
three dimensional perspective. Observed velocity profiles were compared against 
the predictions of multiple common vortex models. Relationships between 
Reynolds stresses, turbulent energies, strain rates, and dissipation were
examined to gain understanding of the compact core behavior, and to help 
explain the models performance.

\chapter{Experiment Setup}
A complete particle image velocimetry system was installed in the ODU low speed 
wind tunnel and employed to measure three-dimensional velocity fields produced 
by an axial vortex at multiple nominal velocities $V_{nom}$ and multiple 
interrogation planes. The interrogation planes were defined by their 
distance downstream of trailing edges of the bi-wing the vortex generator 
$I_Z$. Nominal wind tunnel velocity was varied from 15$m/s$ to 33$m/s$, 
sampling 10 distinct velocities in increments of 2$m/s$. The interrogation 
plane was moved at irregular intervals from 546$mm$ to 1016$mm$ as shown in 
table \ref{table:test_matrix_table}. This chapter discuss details of the 
experimental setup used to produce these datasets, including wind tunnel 
control, vortex generator setup, PIV system calibration, data acquisition, data 
processing, and data quality control.
