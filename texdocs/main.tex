\abstract{
	Vortices are a common phenomenon in fluid flows that arise as kinetic 
	energy dissipates into heat via viscous interaction. They arise naturally 
	at large scales in the form of dust devils, tornadoes, and in the wake of 
	aircraft. It is important to understand the conditions leading to their 
	formation, their duration, and their dissipation to prevent undesirable 
	effects. Among these effects is an decrease in safety of aircraft 
	operations in the wake of other aircraft, an extremely common situation at 
	airports around the world. A large number of mathematical models and 
	experimental data exists to help explain various aspects of axial wake 
	vortex behavior, but current models fail to understand why many vortices 
	remain tightly wound about their cores for as long as they have been 
	observed to do. The current study builds upon the theoretical work of Ash, 
	Zardadkhan and Zuckerwar \cite{ash2011}, and tests specific attributes of a 
	vortex for agreement with non-equilibrium pressure relaxation theory. This 
	theory provides an exact solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for an 
	axial vortex, with a resulting velocity model that agrees with leading 
	empirical models. Axial wake vortices were created with a bi-wing vortex 
	generator in a low speed wind tunnel, at free stream velocities between 15 
	and 33 $m/s$. Stereo particle image velocimetry was employed to 
	map three dimensional velocity vectors at positions between 5.4 and 10 
	chord lengths behind the vortex generator at a rate of 1Hz for 200 seconds. 
	A Reynolds time averaging approach was used to synthesize this velocity 
	data into stable and fluctuating components and to study turbulent 
	structures within the vortices.The core of these vortices was observed to 
	periodically ingest turbulent energy and squeeze it to within one half of a 
	core radii. The cyclical ingestion of turbulence was shown to have the 
	effect of significantly reducing the core radius. If this phenomena 
	persists for the life of the vortex, it could provide an explanation for 
	the longevity of the azimuthal velocity component observed in natural wake 
	vortices.

\prefacesection{Notes}
Good practice for preserving the code used to perform this research was 
attempted by use of git version control software and a git repository. All code 
used to perform data analysis and visualization, along with the raw three 
dimensional vector dataset can be downloaded from
