# thesis-pivpr/py
Code for synthesis of PIV data for demonstration of pressure relaxation phenomena. This is the second and better version of the codebase rewritten in python.

Thesis data was taken of an axial wake vortex in the ODU low speed wind tunnel with a stereo particle image velocimetry system. 
This code is built to synthesize this raw cartesian PIV imagery into a 3d velocity vector field in cylindrical coordinates about
the center of the vortex.
