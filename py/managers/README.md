## Managers
Contains heirarchal classes for building up to AxialVortex instances which have all inherent methods. 

### to-do

[ ] create controler scripts to construct AxialVortex instances and generate output plots procedurally (image format?)
[ ] set plotting methods to auto-bound image extents as function of distance from vortex core
[ ] generalize plotting methods to return figure handles so a parent function can nest subfigures easily
[ ] move vortex specific methods from MeanVecFieldCylindrical to AxialVortex
[ ] finish scatter plotting methods
