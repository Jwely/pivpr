Code for synthesis of PIV data for demonstration of pressure relaxation phenomena

Thesis data was taken of an axial wake vortex in the ODU low speed wind tunnel with a stereo particle image velocimetry system. 
This code is built to synthesize this raw cartesian PIV imagery into a 3d velocity vector field in cylindrical coordinates about
the center of the vortex.
